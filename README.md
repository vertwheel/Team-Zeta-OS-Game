Software version: 
Unity 2021.2.10f1

Installation and Use:
You need to install Unity to play the application. Please refer to the InstallationInstructions.pdf for more details.
The software will be deployed on the Unity website (TBC).

Known bugs:
When dragging the boxes onto the conveyor belt sometimes they will attach to two attachment points instead of one resulting in a gap on the belt. This Bug is purely visual; it has no impact on the game function.
In the coding part of the game moving the mouse cursor too quickly will drag a coding section and drop the code instead.

Description: 
This project aims to create an educational game that teaches the end-user to engage with concurrent programming concepts visually and interactively. The concurrent programming concept that we have chosen for the player is completing a CPU scheduling algorithm and scripts on Java threads. By the end of the game, the player should understand the idea of CPU scheduling and how tasks are given priority in a particular algorithm and how multithreading in Java works. The user will traverse through different CPU sorting algorithms and complete these different algorithms in a set amount of time. After completing the belt algorithms, the user would move on to a new concurrent programming concept. The coding section of the game teaches the user how multithreading in Java works. The user would drag and drop code into the blanks to complete the level and then move on to the next thread programme level; if they fail one level, they start again from the beginning.
